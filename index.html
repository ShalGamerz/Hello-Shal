        <p>Pollution, we hear it eavery other day in our school, college, and read about it in newspapers. So what is
            it? <b>Pollution occurs when pollutants contaminate the natural surroundings;</b> which brings about changes
            that affect our normal lifestyle adversely. Pollutants are the key elements or components of pollution which
            are generally waste materials of different forms. Pollution disturbs our ecosystem and the balance in the
            environment. With modernization and developement in our lives, pollution has reached its peak; giving rise
            to <b>global warming and human illness</b>. <br>
            <br>

            Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called
            pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity,
            such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.<br>
            <br>


            Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust pipes.
            Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage and sewage that
            can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and insects—seep into
            waterways and harm wildlife.<br>
            <br>


            All living things—from one-celled microbes to blue whales—depend on Earth’s supply of air and water. When
            these resources are polluted, all forms of life are threatened.<br>
            <br>


            Pollution is a global problem. Although urban areas are usually more polluted than the countryside,
            pollution can spread to remote places where no people live. For example, pesticides and other chemicals have
            been found in the Antarctic ice sheet. In the middle of the northern Pacific Ocean, a huge collection of
            microscopic plastic particles forms what is known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.<br>
            <br>
            Pollution is of many types, but commonly known are air, soil, and water pollution. Let us know about them
